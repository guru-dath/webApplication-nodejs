# web-application-deploy,
In this project, you will containerize a web application using Docker and set up a basic Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to package applications with Docker and automate the deployment process.

Key Steps and Components:

Develop a web application: Create a simple web application using a programming language and framework of your choice. Ensure it has all the necessary dependencies and configuration files.

Dockerize the application: Write a Dockerfile to define the application's runtime environment, dependencies, and commands needed to run the application within a Docker container. Build a Docker image from the Dockerfile.

Set up version control: Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes in your code. Create a repository and commit the web application code.

Configure CI/CD pipeline: Choose a CI/CD platform or tool (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions) to automate the build and deployment process. Set up the pipeline to trigger builds whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

Build and test stage: Configure the CI/CD pipeline to build the Docker image from the source code. Run tests to ensure the application functions correctly within the containerized environment.

Deployment stage: Define a deployment strategy (e.g., deploying to a cloud server, a local development environment) within the CI/CD pipeline. Deploy the Docker image to the target environment.

Continuous deployment: Enable automatic deployment of the application whenever a new version is successfully built and tested.

Documentation: Document the project, including the Dockerfile, CI/CD pipeline configuration, and any additional setup steps required. Include any notable challenges faced during the project and how you addressed them.
